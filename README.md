# Traffic_Congestion_Management

This is a web app for the solution of Traffic Congestion Detection models and also bad road detection models.

## IDEA BRIEF :
1. Congestion Detection:

● Real-time video feeds and AI algorithms monitor and identify traffic

bottlenecks at junctions.

2. Lane-Wise Traffic Detection with Dynamic User Control:

● Monitors individual lanes and allows traffic controllers to
dynamically manage lane usage based on real-time conditions.

3. Bad Road / Pothole Detection:

● Advanced imaging and sensors detect potholes and road surface
issues for prompt maintenance.

4. Data Management with Firebase:

● All traffic and road condition data are securely stored and shared in real-time using Firebase.
